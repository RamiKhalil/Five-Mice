# Five-Mice
In the general problem, n mice start at the corners of a regular n-gon. Each mouse travels towards its closest neighbor (in a counterclockwise direction) at a constant speed. The paths that the mice take form spiral curves.

Each mouse should move a distance d towards its neighboring mouse. That is, towards the closest mouse in a counterclockwise direction. 
Output the coordinates of each mouse to the file.
